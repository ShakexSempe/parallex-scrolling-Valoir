        <h3>Education History</h3>
        <p>
        I'm an International Relations Graduate from University of Pretoria having gained my A-levels at the

        Before becoming a self-taught Web Developer, I was a Customer Care agent at the Compensation Fund
        (Department of Labour).
        I started learning to code in 2019 having previously enrolled in an Introduction of IT Fundamentals
        course
        via Coursera and then most recently Free-Code-Camp</p>
