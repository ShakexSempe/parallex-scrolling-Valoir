            I'm an International Relations Graduate from University of Pretoria having gained my A-levels at the
            International School of South Africa. <br><br>
            Before becoming a self-taught Web Developer, I was a Customer Care agent at the Compensation Fund
            (Department of Labour).
            I started learning to code in 2019 having previously enrolled in an Introduction of IT Fundamentals course
            via Coursera and then most recently <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/boitumelo-sempe" target="_blank"

            I'm a self taught front end developer with a keen interest in Responsive Web Design and an aspiration to
            progress into a Full Stack Web Developer.
            My skill set is built up from various online platforms such as Free-Code-Camp, Coursera, W3schools,
            Traversey Media and Udemy.
